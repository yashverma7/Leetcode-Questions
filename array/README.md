# ARRAY
## Running Sum of 1d Array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6





## Shuffle the Array

Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].


Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], n = 2
Output: [1,2,1,2]

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 500
nums.length == 2n
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^3



## Richest Customer Wealth

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

 

Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

Example 2:

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.

Example 3:

Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
 

Constraints:

m == accounts.length
n == accounts[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100



## Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

 

Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: 
Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 

Example 2:

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy, therefore only kid 1 will have the greatest number of candies among the kids regardless of who takes the extra candy.

Example 3:

Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
 

Constraints:

2 <= candies.length <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50


## How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 500
0 <= nums[i] <= 100


## Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
Explanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].
The second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].
At the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,3]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
nums.length % 2 == 0
1 <= nums[i] <= 100


## XOR Operation in an Array

Given an integer n and an integer start.

Define an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2*i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.

Return the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, start = 0
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.
Where "^" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, start = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.

Example 3:

Input: n = 1, start = 7
Output: 7

Example 4:

Input: n = 10, start = 5
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= start <= 1000
n == nums.length

## Create Target Array in the Given Order

Given two arrays of integers nums and index. Your task is to create target array under the following rules:

Initially target array is empty.
From left to right read nums[i] and index[i], insert at index index[i] the value nums[i] in target array.
Repeat the previous step until there are no elements to read in nums and index.
Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion operations will be valid.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
Explanation:
nums       index     target
0            0        [0]
1            1        [0,1]
2            2        [0,1,2]
3            2        [0,1,3,2]
4            1        [0,4,1,3,2]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,0], index = [0,1,2,3,0]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
nums       index     target
1            0        [1]
2            1        [1,2]
3            2        [1,2,3]
4            3        [1,2,3,4]
0            0        [0,1,2,3,4]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], index = [0]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length, index.length <= 100
nums.length == index.length
0 <= nums[i] <= 100
0 <= index[i] <= i

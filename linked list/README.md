## 876. Middle of the Linked List

Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100.



## 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer 

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10

Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

Example 3:

Input: head = [1]
Output: 1
Example 4:

Input: head = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 18880
Example 5:

Input: head = [0,0]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
